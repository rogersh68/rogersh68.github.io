        <h3>Chapter 11: Further Functions</h3>
        <p>Function properties and methods</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All functions have length property, call() or apply() method</li>
            <li>Gives flexibility over how functions can be used</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Immediately Invoked function expressions IIFE</p>
        <ul>
            <li>function that is invoked as soon as its defined</li>
            <li>achieved by placing parentheses at the end of the function definition</li>
            <li>can be used to set up any initialization code that there’ll be no need for again. Because the code is only run once, there’s no need to create any reusable, named functions, and all the variables will also be temporary.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Self-defining functions</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a function is able to define itself, and redefine itself.</li>
            <li>This is done by assigning an anonymous function to a variable that hasthe same name as the function.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Recursive functions</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a function that will invoke itself until a certain condition is met</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Callbacks</p>
        <ul>
            <li>functions passed to other functions as arguments and then invoked inside the function they are passed to</li>
            <li>can get complicated when there are lots of them in a function (Callback Hell)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Promises</p>
        <ul>
            <li>When a promise is created, it calls an asynchronous operation and is then said to bepending. It remains in this state while the operation is taking place. At this stage, the promise is said to beunsettled. Once the operation has completed, the promise is said to have beensettled. A settled promise can result in two different outcomes
                <ul>
                    <li>Resolved ― the asynchronous operation was completed successfully.</li>
                    <li>Rejected ― the asynchronous operation didn’t work as expected, wasn't successfully completed or resulted in an error.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Async functions</p>
        <ul>
            <li>they allow you to write asynchronous code as if it was synchronous</li>
            <li>This will wrap the return value  of the function in a promise that can then be assigned to a variable.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Closures</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A closure is a reference to a variable that was created inside the scope of another function, but is then kept alive and used in another part of the program.</li>
            <li>an 'inner' function, which is declared inside another function, has full access to all of the variables declared inside the scope of the function in which it’s declared (the 'outer' function)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Currying</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a process that involves the partial application of functions</li>
            <li>A function is said to be curried when not all arguments have been supplied to the function, so it returns another function that retains the arguments already provided, and expects the remaining arguments that were omitted when the original function was called. A final result is only returned once all the expected arguments have eventually been provided.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Chapter 13: Ajax</h3>
        <p>Clients and servers</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A client, such as a web browser, will request a resource (usually a web page) from a server, which processes the request and sends back a response to the client.</li>
            <li>Ajax allows JavaScript to request resources from a server on behalf of the client. The resources requested are usually JSON data or small fragments of text or HTML rather than a whole web page.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>A brief history of Ajax</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Asynchronous: when a request for data is sent the program doesn't have to stop and wait for a resonse. It can keep running and handle the data when it is received.</li>
            <li>JavaScript: by itself is 'front-end' with Ajax it can update in real time</li>
            <li>XML: these documents used to be used for return data, now most commonly used is JSON</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Communicating with the server using the Fetch API</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Fetch API provides a global fetch() method that only has one mandatory argument, which is the URL of the resource you wish to fetch.</li>
            <li>JSON is the most common format for ajax responses. Use json() method.</li>
        </ul>
