            <h2>Hick's Law</h2>
            <h3>Apple</h3>

            <p>Hick's Law states that with more choices the more likely people will take longer to make decisions and
                the more difficult your website will be to use.</p>
            <p>Apple wants people to buy their products and they have made it easy to do so by only offering a couple of
                options at a time.</p>
            <p>Their homepage lists their newest products. You can only see one product at a time and then it only gives
                you the options to either learn more or buy.</p>
            <p>This makes it easy on the user because they don't have to work hard at deciding what they want to do.</p>

            <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
            <h3>Photoshop</h3>
            <a href="https://www.photoshop.com/">photoshop.com</a>
            <img src="images/photoshop_ruleofthirds.jpg" alt="Photoshop Home Page">
            <p>The picture displayed on the Photoshop homepage exemplifies the Rule of Thirds. </p>
            <p>The Rule of Thirds says that an image should be divided by two equally spaced vertical lines and two
                equally spaced horizontal lines and that important elements of the image should be situated at the
                intersections of the lines or along them.</p>
            <p>The cloud that the child is riding is along the bottom third and the child sits at the intersection of
                the right bottom lines.</p>

            <h2>Contrast</h2>
            <h3>Adobe</h3>
            <a href="https://www.adobe.com/">adobe.com</a>
            <img src="images/adobe_contrast.jpg" alt="Adobe Home Page">
            <p>Adobe's homepage is a great example of Contrast. They have used contrast to make the important elements
                of their homepage pop.</p>
            <p>The first thing you see is their bright red logo. They have made it really bright against a dark blue
                background so that it really draws your eye.</p>
            <p>They have also used contrast to draw your eye to the large white letters that read "Creatitivity for
                all." </p>
            <p>The next thing your eye is drawn to is the bright blue "Start your free trial" button. The brightness of
                the blue contrasts with the dark blue background.</p>
